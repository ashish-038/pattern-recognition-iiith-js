		<p> The respresentation of an object in computer plays the most critical role in our
    ability to distinguish it as a member of a class, and differentiate it from samples of other
    classes. In this experiment, we will carry out a sequence of tasks that reveals the nature
    of different features and its effect on the feature space representation. You will also be
    able to craft your own features and see how it affects the representation and the classification
    performance.</p>

     <p>Objects in real world are complex multi-dimensional entities, characterized
     by their shape, color, texture, weight, chemical and physical composition,
     etc. In a feature representation, each object is reduced to a specific set of
     measurements that the designer deems to be important for the purpose of solving
     the (classification) problem. In this experiment, we will explore the use of

	     <p>Feature extraction allows one to convert a complex object in real world to a
    more tractable sequence of numbers; or a <i>feature vector</i>. The goal of feature
    extraction in the context of pattern classification is to capture those properties of
    a class that makes them different from other classes under consideration.
    </p>
<h3>Types of Feature Vectors</h3>
    <p> Depending on the nature of features that are extracted, the representation could
    be either <i>Fixed Length</i> or <i> Variable Length</i>. In a fixed length representation,
    every object of every class will be represented using a fixed set of numbers. For example,
    for classification of different fruits, each fruit can be represented using the vector:
    <i>(diameter,redness,weight)</i>. However, in certain problems, it is more appropriate not
    to restrict the representation to be fixed length. For example, in the problem of speech
    recognition, the representation of a single word could vary in length depending on the speed
    at which the word is pronounced or the accent of pronounciation.
    </p>
    <p> Fixed length representations are more popular due to the ease of comparing different
    samples. Note that fixed length feature vectors could be thought of as points in a
    <i>d</i>-dimensional vector space, commonly referred to as a <i>feature space</i>.
    We will concentrate on fixed length representations in this experiment.</p>

    <h3>Nearest Neighbor Classifier</h3>
    <p>The <i>Euclidean distance</i> between two points in the feature space can be thought of as a
    measure of dissimilarity between the samples. This fact is used for decision making in the
     popular <i>Nearest Neighbor</i> classifier. A set of labeled samples that are obtained during
     training is stored in the feature space as reference points. When a new sample whose class is
     unknown is obtained, we compare it with each of the reference points in the feature space.
     The closest reference point is the most similar, and hence its class label is assigned to the
     unknown sample. Even though the method is very simple, it is surprisingly effective if the
     feature representation is good. For this reason, the performance nearest neighbor classifier
     is often used to compare different feature representations. In this experiment, we will use
     the accuracy of a nearest neighbor classifier to compare the performances of different feature
     representations.
    </p>
<p> A variant of the nearest neighbor algorithm is the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, where you
    find the class labels of the k nearest reference samples for a new test sample. The label of the
    test sample is decided as the majority label among the reference samples. One could also weight the
    labels according to their similarity (closer samples getting higher weight).
    </p>
    <h3>Other factors affecting the representation</h3>
    <p><b>Nature of Features</b>: Another factor that affects the distribution of samples in the
    feature space is the nature of the features extracted. Some of the features could be binary valued,
    others discrete, while some others could be continuous valued.</p>
    <p><b>Scale of Features</b>: If we have two features, one varying in the range [0,1]$, while the
    second varies in [0,100], then any difference in the second will dominate the distance computation
    between two samples. This effectively makes the first feature, redundant. It is important to make
    sure that the features are computed in similar scales (of numbers) for the representation to be
    effective.</p>

	     Note the structure of the lab: The first pane allows you to select a dataset from a list of available ones. Each dataset has a set of features that have been extracted for your use. You are required to select or create two features for each dataset such that resultant feature space representation is effective. You can visualize the data in the feature space, once you define the features. You can also check the accuracy of the resulting nearest neighbor classifier on a set of test samples
	     </p>
	    <p>
	     <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
	     <ol>
	<li>Load the 0-1 dataset and select the first two features. </li>
	<li>Display the samples in a 2-d feature space</li>
	<li>Click the classify button to check the accuracy of the NN classifier for the chosen representation.</li>
	<li>Note the target accuracy for the experiment. Modify the features to achieve the target accuracy.</li>
	    Note: You can get a complete view of the data samples and the corresponding features below the experiment pane. Plot different features to get an idea of the nature of different features. Derive new features based on this by combining multiple features using addition or multiplication. 

	     </ol>
	    <p>
	     <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
	     <ol>
	     <li>Repeat the above procedure for the different datasets given in the experiment. In each case, note the target accuracy and try to achieve it. Note that in some cases, you may not be able to cross the target accuracy using the provided features only (see next stage).</li>

	     <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
	     <ol>
	     <li>Read the instructions on how to extract your own features for the datasets. Extract the features using your favorite programming environment, and dump the features into an xml file in the specified format.</li>
	     <li>Use these new features that you created to achieve the target accuracy in cases where you were not able to do with the features provided.</li>
