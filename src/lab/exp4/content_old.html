Generating Random Numbers
</h1>

<div id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p> Random numbers are the most important ways in which we model noise in real-world
    processes. The nature of randomness varies according to the actual phenomena that is
    causing the randomness. For example, if we roll a dice, the result can vary between
    1 to 6, where all numbers are equally likely. But it we take the sum of rolling two
    dice, getting a 2 or 12 is less likely than getting a 7. See the image below to have
    an intuitive understanding as to why this happens. The variations in randomness is
    modeled using probability distribution functions or probability density functions.</p>

    <p> Nature has its ways of generating randomness. However, computers are designed to
    be deterministic and hence generating randomness is not a simple task.
    In this experiment, we will try to gain an understanding of random numbers and
    how we can generate randomness of different properties (distributions). You need to
    carefully go through the introduction to random numbers and densities before attempting
    this experiment.</p>

<div id="theory">
    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p> As mentioned in the introduction, computers are designed to be deterministic, and
    cannot generate randomness. Hence to generate a random set of numbers, one of the 
    following approaches is used:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> Use a physical device (sensor) that captures a natural phenomenon, and convert
        the readings to digital form.
        </li>
        <li> Use special functions called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">
        Pseudorandom Number Generators</a> to a generate random-looking set of numbers.
    </ul>
    </p>
    The second method is easier and inexpensive, and hence is the most commonly used one.
    However, if one needs high quality randomness, the first method is often resorted to.
    One can also use a mixture of the two using measurement of some of the operating system
    parameters as a seed for randomness. In any case, the random numbers generated will follow
    a specific distribution. Hence we need to modify the resulting numbers to make it follow
    the distribution or density function that we desire.</P

<div id="procedure">
    <h2> Procedure </h2>
    <p> .</p>
    <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Set the default parameters and click the generate button; Observe the
        dataset for multiple instances of samples. </li>
        <li> Click the estimate button to compute the mean and covariance of the generated samples;
        Observe the mismatch between the two. Repeat the process for multiple sets of samples generated
        from the same distribution and observe the variations in the estimate</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Repeat the above procedure for the different values for the number of generated samples. </li>
        <li> Plot a graph between the average error, and number of samples</li>
        <li> Note down your inferences regarding the graph</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Generate your own dataset by clicking on the plot area. Note that the distribution
        need not be similar to a normal density.</li>
        <li> Estimate the mean and covarance matrices</li>
        <li> Note down your inferences regarding the error committed if you assume the
        distribution to be normal.</li>
    </ol>
