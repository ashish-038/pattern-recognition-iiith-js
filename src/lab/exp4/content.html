	     <p> Random numbers are the most important ways in which we model noise in real-world
	     processes. The nature of randomness varies according to the actual phenomena that is
	     causing the randomness. For example, if we roll a dice, the result can vary between
	     1 to 6, where all numbers are equally likely. But it we take the sum of rolling two
	     dice, getting a 2 or 12 is less likely than getting a 7. See the image below to have
	     an intuitive understanding as to why this happens. The variations in randomness is
	     modeled using probability distribution functions or probability density functions.</p>

	     <p> Nature has its ways of generating randomness. However, computers are designed to
	     be deterministic and hence generating randomness is not a simple task.
	     In this experiment, we will try to gain an understanding of random numbers and
	     how we can generate randomness of different properties (distributions). You need to
	     carefully go through the introduction to random numbers and densities before attempting
	     this experiment.</p>

	     <p> As mentioned in the introduction, computers are designed to be deterministic, and
	     cannot generate randomness. Hence to generate a random set of numbers, one of the 
	     following approaches is used:</p>
	     <p>
	     <ul>
		<li> Use a physical device (sensor) that captures a natural phenomenon, and convert
		the readings to digital form.
		</li>
		<li> Use special functions called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">
		   Pseudorandom Number Generators</a> to a generate random-looking set of numbers.
	     </ul>
	     </p>
	     <p>
	     The second method is easier and inexpensive, and hence is the most commonly used one.
	     However, if one needs high quality randomness, the first method is often resorted to.
	     One can also use a mixture of the two using measurement of some of the operating system
	     parameters as a seed for randomness. In any case, the random numbers generated will follow
	     a specific distribution. Hence we need to modify the resulting numbers to make it follow
	     the distribution or density function that we desire.</p>
