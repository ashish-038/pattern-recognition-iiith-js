	     <p> Linear perceptron is one of the simplest learning algorithms for a two-class classifier.
	     Given a set of data points in d-dimensions, belonging to two classes, <i>C1</i> and <i>C2</i>,
	     the algorithm tries to find a linear separating hyper-plane between the samples of the
	     two classes. If the samples are in one, two or three dimensions, the separating hyperplane
	     would be a point, line or a plane respectively. The specific algorithm that we look into is a special
	     case of a class of algorithms that uses gradient descent on a carefully defined objective function
	     to arrive at a solution.</p>

	     <p>Assume that the samples of the
	     two classes are linearly separable in the feature space.  i.e., there exists a plane <b>w.x</b>+<i>w0 = 0</i>
	     such that all samples belonging to the first class are on one side of the plane, and all samples of the
	     second class are on the opposite side. If such planes exist, the goal of the perceptron algorithm
	     is to learn any one such plane, given the data points. Once we learn the plane, it will be easy to classify
	     new points in the future, as the points on one side of the plane will result in a positive value for
	     <b>w.x</b>+<i>w0</i>, while points on the other side will give a negative value.</p>

	     <h3>Special Case: One dimensional feature vector</h3>
	     <p> To understand the working of the algorithm, we first take the simplest case, where the
	     samples are represented by a single feature (one-dimensional).</p>
