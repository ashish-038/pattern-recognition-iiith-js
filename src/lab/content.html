	       The virtual lab on Pattern Recognition is design to supplement a senior undergraduate or
	       graduate level course in Statistical Pattern Recognition. The experiments are designed to
	       improve the clarity in understanding of the basic concepts as well as to enable the student
	       to put them into practical use. It is important that the student goes through the objectives
	       and the underlying theory before carrying out the experiments to get maximum benefit.</p>

	       <p>The primary reference (textbook) for the topics covered by the experiments is:
	       <i>Pattern Classification (2nd ed.)</i>, by R.O. Duda, P.E. Hart and D.G. Stork.</p>

	       <!--p>Before you start any of the experiments, make sure you read the <a href="#notes">notes</a> section below. </p>
	       <h2> <a name="notes">Notes on Experiments</a> </h2-->
		  <p>
		  The experiments are designed to expose you to certain concepts. You are encouraged to carry out
		  variants of the suggested experiments and learn from them.
		  Please make sure that you read the background material and
		  experiment procedure before carrying out the experiments. Trying
		  out the experiments before this does not hurt, but having the
		  background will help you understand the results better.
